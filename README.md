# DevOps Projects

This repository documents my transition from Systems Support to DevOps Engineering. It showcases hands-on projects, experiments, and real-world implementations as I build and sharpen skills in Linux system administration, automation, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, monitoring, and cloud computing (AWS).

Each project is a step forward on my journey toward becoming a Cloud DevOps Engineer, with a strong focus on automation, scalability, and reliability using modern DevOps practices and tools.

“From scripting to scaling — this repo is the blueprint of my DevOps evolution.”
