# DevOps Projects

Welcome to my DevOps lab ‚Äî a curated collection of hands-on projects, labs, and experiments as I transition from Systems Support to a professional Cloud DevOps Engineer.

This repository is the engine room of my learning journey ‚Äî where theory meets practice. It covers the entire DevOps lifecycle: from Linux system administration and scripting to CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, monitoring, and cloud-native deployments.

üõ†Ô∏è "From scripting to scaling ‚Äî this repo is the blueprint of my DevOps evolution."
