# üöÄ **DevOps Projects by Enoch Olaleye**

Welcome to my **DevOps Projects** repository! This is where I document my hands-on experiments, labs, and projects as I grow into a Cloud DevOps Engineer. It showcases the tools, technologies, and practices I‚Äôm mastering along the way to automate, scale, and manage systems efficiently.

Each project here represents a milestone on my journey, with a focus on:
- **Linux system administration**
- **Automation using scripts and tools like Ansible**
- **CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins & GitHub Actions**
- **Cloud deployments (AWS)** 
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform & Ansible**
- **Containers & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)**

> üõ†Ô∏è _"This repository is my blueprint to mastering DevOps through continuous learning and hands-on experience."_

## üìù **What‚Äôs Inside**

### **Projects**
This repo includes a variety of projects based on different DevOps tools and concepts. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find:
- **Linux for DevOps**: User management, bash scripting, cron jobs for automation
- **Cloud (AWS)**: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM hands-on labs for real-world deployments
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows with Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Writing reusable Terraform and Ansible code for AWS provisioning
- **Containers & Orchestration**: Docker containers, multi-container Docker Compose setups
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Setting up Prometheus & Grafana for system monitoring, ELK Stack for logging
- **Security**: IAM policies, secrets management, and DevSecOps best practices

### **Current Projects**
Here‚Äôs a sneak peek of some current projects I‚Äôm working on:
- **Linux Automation**: Automating common system tasks with cron and bash scripts
- **AWS S3 Static Website**: Deploying static sites using AWS S3 + Route 53
